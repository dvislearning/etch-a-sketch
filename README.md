# etch-a-sketch

An "etch-a-sketch" built using Javascript and jQuery. This is an exercise from an online class at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery).

Three different modes are provided:

* **Normal**: where the user hovers the cursor over a black square and it changes to blue. The user may also define the dimensions of the grid, anywhere from 1 x 1 to 81 x 81 squares.


* **Random color**: A random color is generated each time the cursor hovers over a square.

* **Gradient**: Each time a user passes the cursor over a square, its opacity reduces by 10%, until the square disappears completely after 10 passes.
